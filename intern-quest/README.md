# Intern Quest  Quick & Fun Guide

Welcome to *Intern Quest*, your tiny, friendly job-application tracker.

Get started (super quick)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser: http://localhost:5173/

What you can do

- Add a job using the form (title + company).
- Click "Edit" to change title or company.
- Click the status button to toggle between "Applied" and "Interviewing".
- Click "Remove" to delete a job.

Everything you add is saved in your browser so you can close the tab and come back.

Files you might edit next

- `src/App.jsx` — where the list and form live.
- `src/JobCard.jsx` — card UI and actions (edit/remove/toggle).
- `src/App.css` — tweak colors and spacing here.

Have fun — Liza! 🚀
